# This script organizes files in the Downloads folder into categorized subfolders based on their file extensions.
# It creates folders for images, documents, videos, music, archives, and scripts, moving files accordingly.
# Unrecognized file types are reported but not moved.
# Make sure to run this script in an environment where you have permission to modify the Downloads folder
# and that you have Python installed.
# You can run this script periodically to keep your Downloads folder organized.
